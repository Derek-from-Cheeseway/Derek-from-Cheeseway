# Hello, I'm Derek - the developer of CheeseWay

**CheeseWay** is a cozy little donation platform built for creators - especially developers - who want something more than just a "Buy Me a Coffee" button or a Patreon that isnâ€™t really made for devs.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ CheeseWay includes:

- âœ… A public roadmap that supports donations, feature voting, and suggestions - great for open-source software developers or anyone building in public
- âœ… A real-time survey system (embeddable on live streams using e.g. OBS) with the same interactive features

### About the project

I launched the MVP on **July 17, 2025**. Itâ€™s fully usable and currently optimized for desktop (Mobile UI is still on the [roadmap](https://cheeseway.io/roadmap/cmd91jjwu000pg3opr64ht7jh))

If you have any questions, concerns, found a bug or you are just curious of the app, reach out to me at support@cheeseway.io. I'd really appreciate it ðŸ˜Š
